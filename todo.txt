
For v1.0
--------
EfanErr wraps compilation Err - pretty print both

For v1.0.2
----------
use afIoc to make() the renderers - Can Helpers define afIoc services? (need to add facets to plastic)



Future:
-------
Contribute compilation hooks so external people can add their own generated methods & fields
